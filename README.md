# FoodDeliverySystem-MachineCoding

Duration: 90 mins

Implement an online food ordering system which can be integrated with restaurants. The features of the system are as described below
Each restaurant has a menu with all the items and their respective prices. 
Restaurants have a rating out of 5
Each restaurant, at any given time can process only a certain number of orders. This number is defined as max_no_orders. The system should not assign further orders beyond max_no_of_orders, until any of the ongoing orders is COMPLETED and ready to be dispatched.   
Once an order is ACCEPTED, the restaurant can mark it as COMPLETED when the order is ready to be dispatched. This will free up the processing capacity of the restaurant. A restaurant canâ€™t CANCEL an ACCEPTED order. 
An order will be auto-assigned to a restaurant based on a selection strategy. Eg: Assign by lowest cost or best rating. 
An order will be auto-assigned to a restaurant only if all the items in an order can be fulfilled by a single restaurant. Else the order will not be ACCEPTED.
An order placed once cannot be modified

The software application MUST meet the following requirements
Ability to onboard a new restaurant.
Onboarded restaurant should be able to update its menu. ( Deletion of items in the menu is not allowed )
Ability to mark an ACCEPTED order as COMPLETED
A customer should be able to place an order with the following details
Items and their quantity
Selection Strategy
Implement at least one of the two selection strategies
Lowest Bill Cost
Highest Rating 


EXPECTATIONS

MUST HAVES
Working code which is demoable
Functional correctness
Selection Strategy should be pluggable
Proper entity/domain object modelling, separation of concerns
Modular code with is unit-testable
Exception and Error Handling

GOOD TO HAVES
Use of design patterns

DO NOT make use of any kind of database to store information. All information should be in-memory using the appropriate data structures. 

DO NOT emphasize and spend too much time on reading the input. Input data can be taken in any manner. Hard-code in the main driver program. Read from file etc. It should be flexible enough to modify quickly and easily if needed by the interviewer.

		Items:
			Idli : 3
			Dosa : 1
		Selection: Lowest Cost
	Output:
		Order assigned to R3

Order 02
	Input:
		User: Harish
		Items:
			Idli : 3
			Dosa : 1
		Selection: Lowest Cost
	Output:
		Order assigned to R2
